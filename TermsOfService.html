    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: January 10, 2026</p>

    <p>Welcome to Proofset! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Proofset mobile application ("App") operated by Harry Stoltz ("we," "us," or "our").</p>

    <p>By downloading, installing, or using Proofset, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Proofset is a mobile application that converts photographs of handwritten mathematical notes into LaTeX code and PDF documents using artificial intelligence. The service includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Image capture and import functionality</li>
        <li>AI-powered conversion of handwritten math to LaTeX</li>
        <li>PDF generation from LaTeX code</li>
        <li>Document storage and management</li>
        <li>Export and sharing capabilities</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Account Registration</h2>
    <p>To use Proofset, you must create an account using either:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sign in with Apple</li>
        <li>Email and password</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. You must provide accurate and complete information when creating your account.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscription Plans and Payment</h2>
    <h3>Free Tier</h3>
    <p>All users receive 20 free pages per week. This limit resets every Monday at midnight UTC.</p>
    
    <h3>Pro Subscription</h3>
    <p>The Pro subscription provides 200 pages per week and is available for $4.99 USD per month (or equivalent in your local currency). Subscription details:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase</li>
        <li>Subscription automatically renews unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period</li>
        <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period at the same price</li>
        <li>You can manage and cancel your subscription in your device's Settings → Apple ID → Subscriptions</li>
        <li>Any unused portion of a free trial period, if offered, will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription</li>
        <li>Refunds are handled by Apple according to their refund policy</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Subscription and Apple ID</h3>
    <p>Your Pro subscription is tied to your Apple ID, not your Proofset account. This means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The subscription is valid on any device signed into the same Apple ID</li>
        <li>If multiple Proofset accounts are used on the same device with an active subscription, all accounts will have access to Pro features</li>
        <li>If you sign into a different Apple ID, you will need to restore purchases or subscribe again</li>
    </ul>
